initSidebarItems({"mod":[["basis_spline","B-splines are commonly used as basis functions to fit smoothing curves to large data sets.  To do this, the abscissa axis is broken up into some number of intervals, where the endpoints of each interval are called breakpoints.  These breakpoints are then converted to knots by imposing various continuity and smoothness conditions at each interface.
